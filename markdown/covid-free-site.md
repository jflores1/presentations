Covid-19 caught us all off guard

;;;


Perhaps noone hit as hard as main Street businesses & nonprofits

;;;

Gap exposed b/w the technologically well-heeled and those who aren’t
  - Retail/E-Commerce
  - Restaurants/Curbside Pickups
  - Stylists offering consultations

---

We’re already offering 10% off all our standard services

---

But, we can do more to help those businesses furthest behind the curve.

---

To do that, we're giving away FREE websites to qualified organizations to help them get their digital presence back on track.

---

Here's how it works:

;;;

1. Apply for a free website. Tell us how Covid-19 has impacted your business and what your plan is, coming out of it.

;;;

2. We'll review your application within 1 business day and let you know if you're approved for a free website

;;;

3. If you're approved, sign up for one of our website management plans
- $99/month for non-ecommerce websites
- $199/month for e-commerce websites

;;;

And the websites, which usually cost $400-$800 will be free!

---

Of course, some restrictions will apply.

---

After all, we're a small business, too.

---

Some of those include:

1. The website has to come from our catalog of ~100 pre-designed websites <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. We will modify the site to suit your needs. (logos, etc) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. But no scope creep <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

What if you're not selected?

;;;

As much as we'd like to, we can't help everyone

;;;

We can't give away completely customized websites

;;;

But will still offer our 10% discount on those sites

;;;

Those sites still have 6-month payment terms, to help with cash flow

---

We'll do our best to try and work with any business trying to 'figure out the tech stuff' during this time period.

;;;

Our primary goal is to help you reset your tech, while the economy resets

---

Things are going to be different coming out of this

---

But we're in this together.

So, apply today!
