## What is a Marketing Channel?

First thing's first: how does a business breathe?

;;;

## What is a Channel?

Money is Oxygen.

;;;

## What is a Channel?

More specifically, **Profit** is Oxygen.

## What is a Channel?

Profit is produced when you _provide value_ to _people who need it_ by using _fewer resources to provide that value_ than those people are willing to pay for it.

## What is a Marketing Channel?

2 Dimensions of a marketing channel

1. Allow you to _communicate value_,
2. To _people who need it_,

;;;

**(Ideally) _Profitably_**

## Two Types of Channels

Generally, there are two types of channels:

1. Customers are Looking for You.
2. You go looking for customers.

;;;

## Two Types of Channels

I think of these channels as:

1. Search channels
2. Prospecting channels

---

## Search Channels

Channels where customers are looking for you.

;;;

### Examples of Search Channels

- Old school: Yellow Pages
- New: Google PPC, (increasingly) Siri/Yelp, etc.

;;;

### Examples of Search Channels

Can vary by industry

- Thumbtack, Angie's List
- Doordash, Uber Eats, Grubhub
- Amazon (e-commerce)

;;;

### Benefits of Search Channels

- Higher conversion rates
- Qualified customers 'ready to buy'
- Often easier to 'measure' and 'manage'

;;;

### Downsides of Search Channels

- Competitive
- Commodotize service
- "Expensive"

---

## Prospecting Channels

Prospecting channels are ones where you (or your agent) go _looking_ for customers. 

- Customers not looking for you
- Need to attract attention & nurture it

;;;

### Examples of Prospecting Channels

- Networking, referral groups
- Billboards
- "Display" Ads
- Social Media Ads
- Etc.

;;;

### Benefits of Prospecting Channels

- (Often) Less expensive to attract attention
- Opportunity to 'stand out' & be unique

### Downsides of Prospecting Channels

- Lower initial conversion rates
- Initial 'touch' is often much less expensive than a 'search channel'
- One touch is usually not enough - requires 'nurturing'
- Getting attention is difficult

Note:
Nurturing can get expensive, quickly. It can be very time-consuming.

---

## How to Choose the Right Channel?

Short answer - it depends.

- Business economics
- Level of 'comfort' with a given channel
- Business capabilities

;;;

### Rules of Thumb: Search Channels

- Great for small businesses that need cash quickly or are just starting out
- Expect to pay a premium for acquisition, but a great way to start working on fundamentals of profitability
- Great way to learn how to 'position' yourself in the market
- Doesn't usually require a lot of operational or technical sophistication to get started
- Do "Search Judo"

Note:
Optimizing can get expensive.

;;;

### Search Judo

Treat search as a channel

;;;

Then, make sure you 'steal' the lead into your database

;;;

Especially at the point of sale.

;;;

Example: Doordash & Restaurants

---

### Rules of Thumb: Prospecting Channels

- Great for extroverts
- Every business owner should work their network first
- Implement a 'test and see' framework with 'risk capital' before committing too much to any campaign or channel
- Avoid 'vanity' metrics like 'impressions' or 'engagement' unless there's a way to leverage it into a remarketing campaign.
- Remarket. Remarket. Remarket.

;;;

"Steal" from Search & build your own "prospecting" channel (email)

Note:
Email isn't dead.

---

## In General

Treat this like Monopoly:

- Green house, green house, green house, green house,
- Hotel

;;;

## In General

1. Start with your network & channels you can work personally
2. Then, "Search Channels"
3. "Steal" from search for your "prospecting channels"
4. "Test" prospecting channels
5. Find one that's profitable and invest..._in addition to_ your search channel  unless you have an economically compelling reason not to.

;;;

## In General

This will start to compound channels, leads, and growth.

---

## Cautionary Tale

Don't lose focus on profitability.

;;;

Or hustle.

Good luck!

## Thank You
