## What is the "Tradeoff Triangle"
Business (and economics) is all about 'tradeoffs' - the idea that _in order to get one thing, you have to give up another._

## What is the "Tradeoff Triangle"

In economics, this is referred to as "Opportunity Cost" - making a decision for _one_ thing, often excludes (at least) _one other_ thing.

## Tradeoffs in Product Development
In product (or service) development, you can often distinguish yourself from competitors by being:

1. Better or
2. Cheaper or
3. Faster

;;;

**Usually, you can achieve _one_ of those things.**

;;;

**This is the "tradeoff triangle"**

## Tradeoffs in Technical Development

In software (or web) development, those tradeoffs are especially strong when _the work being done has customization involved._

;;;

## Tradeoffs in Technical Development

This is what that triangle looks like:

## Tradeoffs in Technical Development

When it comes to development, it _is very, very, (very) rare_ that you can get ALL 3.

## Tradeoffs in Technical Development

**Usually, you can only pick 2**

## Examples of Tradeoffs

"I want a website with the best-in-class design, infrastructure, SEO optimization, etc."

;;;

### Example 1

The premium is clearly on "Quality." But, what's _the next most important thing_?

- Saving money: expect it to take a long time, with a lot of back-and-forth.
- Getting it done quickly: expect to pay for it.

;;;

### Example 2

"I need a website tomorrow"

;;;

### Example 2

The premium is clearly on speed/timing. But, what's _the next most important thing_?

- Saving money: Expect a simple template with minor changes
- Customization: Expect to pay dearly for rush fees, etc.

;;;

### Example 3

"I can't really afford much"

;;;

(You should probably just do it yourself, using any of the great off-the-shelf tools out there)

Note:
Digression

;;;

### Example 3

The premium is clearly on cost control. But, what's _the next most important thing_?

- Getting it done quickly: Expect an 'off-the-shelf' template with very few customizations.
- Customization: You're lucky if this project ever gets done. It won't be a priority to anyone.

## The Point
