## Sales vs. Profit

;;;

Most people think about websites in terms of _sales_.

;;;

Not wrong, but also _incomplete_.

;;;

## Quick Distinction

;;;

Sales = Revenue = Top Line = Overall money coming in

;;;

Profit = (Revenue = Cost) = Bottom Line = What's Left Over

;;;

- Revenue is vanity
- Profit is sanity
- Cash is **King**

;;;

## The Cost Side of Business

;;;

How can a website drive down costs?

;;;

For many businesses, labor = cost


Note:
Often measured in hours

;;;

But we can really think of cost as _the resources_ it takes to accomplish a task.

;;;

To increase profitability, you want to **use fewer resources** to accomplish tasks.

;;;

Here are some ways to do that.

---

## 1. Payment Processing

;;;

How much time is spent chasing invoices or managing payments?

;;;

Implementing payment processing is often convenient for you - and for customers.

;;;

Lots of options
- Accept credit cards
- Handle Subscriptions
- Create Installment Plans

;;;

In addition to reducing collection/billing hassle, **it also helps you get paid faster.**

Note:
Depending on your payment processor, rates might also be cheaper

;;;

Finally, keep up with changing payment methods, such as Apple Pay

Note: 
Millennials soon overtaking boomers as main spenders.

## 2. Book Appointments

;;;

Everyone asks for Contact Forms on their website.

Note:
Not sure how useful they are anymore, but that's another topic

;;;

But, ultimately, the goal is to _connect_ with a _prospect_ or _customer_.

;;;

A lot of (administrative) time can be spent trying to coordinate schedules.

;;;

Online booking can reduce (or eliminate) that.

;;;

For example, we use Calendly to have prospects & customers book appointments
![todo](screenshot-of-calendly)

;;;

### Will people do it?

;;;

Yes, the ones who are serious about learning more.

Note:
Every week, I see a handful of appointments on my calendar

;;;

Because it syncs with Google calendar, availability _updates automatically_.

;;;

You can get a lot of control over availability, too.

Note:
Outside the scope of this post

### When to use it

;;;

Can be used for individual appointments _or classes._

Note:
Like webinars, seminars, etc.

;;;

Can be integrated with payments

;;;

But, it may not be a top-of-the-funnel use case for you.

;;;

Might be something you use for project management, existing customers, or something else.

;;;

**The point is to identify where you are spending time (resources) coordinating efforts, then reduce or eliminate it.**

;;;

#### Final point: 
These get embedded on your website, but that doesn't mean the link has to be public. It can be hidden until you want to share it.

## 3. Digitize Forms

Everyone hates paperwork.

;;;

### Common Paperwork
- Intake forms
- Consent forms
- Project scoping forms
- You get the idea

;;;

If you, your employees, or your customers spend time filling out forms, **investigate moving them online.**

### Some Benefits of Digitization
- Stop deciphering handwriting
- Cut doing data entry
- Automatically push form data into your CRM or database

;;;

### Forms can be make "smart"

;;;

Many paper forms ask _all the questions_ because they aren't dynamic.

;;;

So customers get confused or give 'partial' answers.

Note:
Or, worse, ask you about them

;;;

Instead, make forms smart with _conditional logic_.

;;;

This means you only show _necessary_ fields.

;;;

#### Example: Capital Area Human Society
![FormExample]

;;;

Some fields are particular to specific animals.

;;;

Also, form results _can be_ printed out for offline consumption.

;;;

Point is to investigate this area and figure out how much time & effort could be saved

Note:
That time could belong to you or your customers. Saving customers' time adds to profitability by contributing to top-line sales.

## 4. Reduce/Eliminate Data Entry

;;;

Use your website to help keep information synced between different systems

;;;

### Example, Form Data
1. Form completed
2. Notification sent to email
3. Email checked
4. Data copy & pasted into CRM

;;;

### A Better Way
1. Form completed
2. Data arrives in CRM

;;;

Made possible with off-the-shelf systems such as Zapier or IFTTT.

;;;

**Note: While this can save a lot of work, it does require upfront thought.**
**And the systematization of processes.**

;;;

### Two Examples
1. E-Commerce Example
2. Service Business

;;;

### E-Commerce
1. Discount popup
2. Customer enters email address
2. Email address sent to email marketing system
3. Triggers follow up sequence that offers discount & nurtures to 1st purchase

;;;

### Service Business
1. Payment processed with Stripe
2. Stripe sends data to CRM
3. Stripe sends payment data to Quickbooks

;;;

**Sky's the Limit!**

## 5. Teach Customers/Prospects how to...
- Use Loom videos (or other screensharing software) to record yourself showing customers how to do things
	- self-assess
	- use your tools
- Pair this with a blog (should probably mention first)

---

## 6. Use bots to gauge purchase intent
- Tidio
- Automation workflows
	- straightforward to set up
	- Requires thoughtfulness about your sales process
	- Simple != easy

---

## 7. Build your email list
- Money in the email list
- E-commerce especially: quickly add thousands of dollars in monthly sales through email marketing
- Start a nurture process

---

## 8. Create a “Members Only” area
- Isolate parts of your website for your best customers
