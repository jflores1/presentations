# ProTip #1: Avoid The Budget "Fallacy"

;;;

## ProTip #1

Before we get started, we have to remove some "head trash."

;;;

## ProTip #1

Starting with the word "budget."

;;;

## ProTip #1

The problem with the "budget" frame...

assumes marketing is an expense.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

## ProTip #1

The question _assumes failure_.

Note:
Most common when there is no real plan. And you're throwing 'spaghetti' at the wall.

;;;

## ProTip #1

So, let's start with this maxim...

;;;

**If the marketing strategy is losing money (or you're not sure), stop doing it**.

;;;

## ProTip #1

**Otherwise, keep doing it.**

Note:
Of course, for this to work, you have to measure, but we'll talk about that later.

# ProTip #2: Every Channel is Different

;;;

## ProTip #2

Classical business school definition of marketing:

1. Product
2. Placement
3. Price
4. Promotion

;;;

## ProTip #2

Most people conflate _marketing_ with **promotion**. 

Note:
Only one dimension

;;;

## ProTip #2

**Place** is just as important.

;;;

## ProTip #2

And can vary dramatically by industry (or even campaign).

;;;

## ProTip #2

Example: Contractors outside of Home Depot

;;;

## ProTip #2

Place = Channel

;;;

## ProTip #2

Where are your customers? 

Go there.

;;;

## ProTip #2

Every channel has strengths & weaknesses

;;;

## ProTip #2

Do a quick SWOT analysis for different channels:

1. What are the strengths of this channel?
2. What are the weaknesses of it?
3. What opportunities does it present?
4. What obstacles/factors/threats could reduce it's impact?

# ProTip #3: Every Campaign is Different

;;;

## ProTip #3

Because different channels have different SWOT values, some campaigns will be more effective than others.

;;;

Before campaign planning, think about the channel's "purpose."

;;;

## ProTip #3

Exs. 
- Chambers of commerce attract in-person connection
- BNI exists for referral/network marketing
- Facebook facilitates interpersonal digital connection
- Google Search matches people asking questions to people with answers

;;;

## ProTip #3

Recognizing the _purpose_ of the channel can help temper expectations for what is or is not possible from that channel.

;;;

## ProTip #3

Exs. 

- Need customers now? Consider PPC as a channel. 
- Bringing a new product to market with little/no corrollary? Consider Display or FB
- Want to emphasize 'personal touch?' Networking
- Etc.

;;;

## ProTip #3

Each campaign will require 4 resources:

1. Time <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Effort <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Energy <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Money <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

## ProTip #3

Assess your resources, business need, and channel SWOT review to put together a campaign to accomplish that goal.

---

# ProTip #4: Channel/Campaign Combos Change

;;;

## ProTip #4

As your resource portfolio changes, so will they types and scope of your campaigns

;;;

## ProTip #4

Exs.

- Early stage: Networking, word-of-mouth, referral
- Then: Google PPC
- Then: Display marketing/brand awareness

;;;

## ProTip #4

Avoid the 'hot tactic' of the day and focus channel/resource/objective fit.

;;;

## ProTip #4

General rules of thumb:

- For a young business, money > time
- For a growing/mature business, time > money

---

## ProTip #5: Model Before You Buy

;;;

In order to avoid budget 'fallacy,' have to know if your campaign(s) are _profitable_.

;;;

## ProTip #5
Model it.

;;;

## ProTip #5

Key factors to consider:

- Product Information
- Channel Metrics
- Sales Metrics
- Customer Value

;;;


### Product Information
  - Average unit revenue
  - Average unit costs
  - Profit/unit/
  - Average profit margin

;;;

### Channel Metrics
  - Expected awareness
  - Expected engagement
  - Number of 'engaged' persons

;;;

### Sales Metrics
  - 'Number of engaged' persons
  - Percent of persons who become customers
  - Total expected customers

;;;

### Customer information
  - Average transactions/customer/time-frame
  - Average profit/contribution/customer/time-frame

;;;

## ProTip #5

Working Example

## ProTip #6: Plan to lose, before you win

;;;

## ProTip #6

Set aside 'risk capital' for every channel/campaign combo you pursue.

;;;

## ProTip #6

Every channel requires learning before it can become profitable.

;;;

## ProTip #6

Bound your risk with the metrics above

Including your 'break even' cost of conversion. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

## ProTip #6

Stop when you exceed your risk allotment

---

# ProTip #7: Monitor & Adapt

;;;

## ProTip #7

Most campaigns require tweaking

(Especially online ones) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;


Metrics to watch after you start:

1. Cost of customer acquisition
2. Cost of engagement
3. Funnel metrics

;;;

Beware of "vanity" metrics, such as:

1. Impressions
2. Clicks
3. Views

Note:
Unless you're doing an awareness campaign

;;;

## ProTip #7

Pay attention to how people _actually_ interact versus your _expectations_.

;;;

## ProTip #7

Run your _actual data_ through the same calculator to assess performance.

;;;

## ProTip #7

Some rules of thumb:

- High impressions, low clicks = poor ad or poor offer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Low impressions, high clicks = poor ad, good offer <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Low impressions, low clicks = poor audience <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- High clicks, low conversions = good offer, poor execution <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
