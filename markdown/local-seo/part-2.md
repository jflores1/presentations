## Google's mission is to organize all the world's information & make it accessible

;;;

If you want to **show up on searches** you have to **help Google help you**

;;;

To keep users coming back, Google's results must be perceived as:
- Trustworthy
- Authoritative
- Relevant

;;;

But it also has to provide a **great user experience**

---

Thankfully, Google provides some **free tools** to help you start helping them.

---

But one tool **stands out** above others as **the most important free tool** they give you...

---

## Your Google Business Profile

# Why is this tool so important?

;;;

## Remember: Google's mission is to organize all the world's information & make it accessible

;;;

So they _really_ care about the answer to these two questions...

What is someone expecting to find when they click "search?" 

How can we help them find that as fast as possible? <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: people on the Internet arenâ€™t patient.

---

### So, what is someone looking for when they search for "{type of company} near me?"

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> The <strong>best</strong> service provider 
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Nearest</strong> to them or within a reasonable distance

---

That's pretty broad. So, how does the searcher define success?

(Remember, Google defines success by the searcher's standards) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### How do searchers define success?

- Information is available that confirms they got the right kind of service provider (relevance) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Geographical information is available that confirms proximity (relevance) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- There's "proof" the service provider is legit (authority, trustworthiness) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Contact information is readily available (trustworthiness) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- More information is readily available if desired (authority, trustworthiness) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### With "typical" results, those criterion aren't necessarily obvious

# So, Google changed their approach

---

### You've probably noticed these boxes starting to pop up across the web
<img style="height: 400px; margin-top: -10px;" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0nrgvdjqs18tnkr/Screenshot%202019-12-09%2016.12.11.png?dl=1"/>

---

These _snippets_ provide that information **at a glance** that **searchers care most about.**

---

<section>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column-50">
            <h3>Searchers can see:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The type of service provider</li>
                <li>Their location</li>
                <li>"Proof" of legitimacy</li>
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <li>Where to learn more</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="column-50">
            <img style="height: 400px; margin-top: -10px;" src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0nrgvdjqs18tnkr/Screenshot%202019-12-09%2016.12.11.png?dl=1"/>

With these boxes, Google is able to provide **relevant, authoritative, trustworthy** results, _quickly_ to it's searchers

---

But _how_ does Google _get_ this information?

---

### This is the best part...

;;;

_You_ give it to them, _they_ index it, and then it becomes available to searchers

;;;

Even better, _this doesn't cost you a dime_

;;;

### All _you_ have to do is claim your Google profile, provide some information, and submit it to be indexed

---

This creates a **win/win** for **you** and for **Google.**

---

Because, once you fill it out, your information is indexed in a way that's _easy_ for Google's crawlers to index AND easier for Google to **recommend your business** to searchers

---

Even better, when you first submit your profile, you'll get a little "bump" while Google gives you an extra opportunity to **prove yourself**

---

Remember, Google wants to provide the most **trustworthy, authoritative, and relevant** results they can muster

---

So, to do that, they have to give newly indexed profiles (and websites) an opportunity to demonstrate they're worthy competitors

---

# So, how do you claim your profile and give your business this boost?

---

That's what I'm going to show you right now.

(Don't worry, it's easy to get started, even if you hate technology)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note: Splice in video doing the walk-through

---

# So, what are the important things to know as you complete this exercise?

;;;

## First, just doing this is HUGE

---

Many businesses don't take the time to complete this **one simple exercise** that can immediately make your business eligible for local searches

---

This is especially surprising because **it's free** to create your profile and actually **helps Google further it's mission**, so it's kind of a no-brainer

---

So, if you **do nothing else for search**, complete your Google Business Profile

(and keep it updated) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

## But, there are some "gotchas"...
- It can take a few weeks to receive your confirmation mail, so plan accordingly <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Beware "keyword stuffing" <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Don't be "spammy" or over-exaggerate claims <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Be sure to fill out as much as you possibly can, but it's ok if the honest answer is 'no answer' for some questions <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Filling out your Google Business Profile will get you started and give you a search bump, but it's NOT a silver bullet <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

(In other words, the bump will fade) <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### To _get ahead_ and _stay ahead_, you need to make sure you get reviews and local citations, and follow website best practices to _earn_ your spot on Google

;;;

In fact, after setting up your profile, **getting reviews** should be your next **highest priority**

;;;

Especially if you're in a really competitive industry

---

### Fortunately, Google provides you a personalized link you can share with customers to get reviews
![link to google review link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q28hiadcesau68a/Screenshot%202019-12-09%2016.39.06.png?dl=1)

---

But, the truth is that **reviews can be really hard to get**

;;;

Often, you ask for them, people verbally commit, but they never actually complete them

---

Unfortunately, while you can control _the ask_, you _can't control_ the action

---

So, in the next training, we'll share some of the tactics **top companies use** to _earn_ their spot on Google and how _you_ can optimize your website to get more local customers

---
