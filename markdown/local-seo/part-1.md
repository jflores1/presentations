# The real problem
The Internet has changed so much, so quickly, that many of us never learned how search engines _were really designed_ to work. As a result, our ideas about how search engines work are incomplete or outdated.

---

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> More visitors to your website become <strong>leads or customers</strong> 
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> Your <strong>advertising becomes more profitable</strong>

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> You have better <strong>control over your growth<strong/> to accomplish your business goals

# What does it mean to rank?
For many of us, when we thinking of ranking, we think of something that looks like this:

---

But is that _really_ where we want to be?

---

Maybe 5 or 10 years ago, this _was_ the coveted spot on Google.

---

But, if we look at a search result _today_:

---

We'll see there's often a whole **bunch of stuff above** that position.

---

For local businesses, you really want to be **above the "normal" search results**.

---

So, how do we get there?

## Updating our Ideas about Google

The **first thing** we need to understand is _what Google actually does_ and why _Google is so successful_.

;;;

### Updating our ideas about Google...

Google’s mission is to organize all the world's information and make it accessible

Note: That’s a really ambitious mission

;;;

To do this, Google has to present the _highest-quality, most relevant results_ to a user's search query.

Note: Google has to make money to accomplish their mission

;;;

And find a way to **monetize it**.

;;;

Right now, Google has an **88% market share** in search.

;;;

Making the company over <strong>$100 Billion</strong> per year.

Note: Search is a winner-take-most market

---

## Google has a lot to lose.

---

## How does Google stay ahead?

They ensure their algorithm returns results that are <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Trustworthy</strong>
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Authoritative</strong>
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Relevant</strong>

;;;

But that’s just part of it...

;;;

Google also recognizes that searchers are _fickle_...

;;;

So, it’s not enough that the results are good, but rather the whole _search experience_ has to be good

;;;

Which means Google - as well as _any website it’s going to recommend_ - provide a **good user experience**.

;;;

If Google keeps doing these two things, then searchers will continue to _use Google_ and Google can continue to _serve ads_ to its _exclusive channel._

;;;

Maintaining it’s **88% market share** and **$100+ Billion** juggernaut

---

## What does this mean for your business?

;;;

### What this means for your business...
Showcasing **your business isn’t important** to Google, unless it meets the criteria of being the most **Trustworthy, Authoritative, and Relevant** result it could possibly return AND provides a **great user experience**. 

---

# The Main Idea:

---

## Help Google, help you

;;;

### To succeed with Google, help Google succeed with _its_ users.

;;;

### How to help Google help you...

- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Tactic 1:</strong> If you want to show up in Google, you have to start with thinking about <em>Google's incentive structure</em>, not your desire to rank.
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Tactic 2:</strong> Make sure you demonstrate <strong>trustworthiness, authority, and relevance</strong> on your website & Google profile
- <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> <strong>Tactic 3:</strong> Provide a <strong>great user-experience</strong> online - and offline

Note: Google owns the channel, you have to play by their rules
