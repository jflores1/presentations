### Google's mission is to organize all the world's information & make it accessible

;;;

If you want to **show up on searches** you have to **help Google help you**

;;;

To keep users coming back, Google's results must be perceived as:
- Trustworthy
- Authoritative
- Relevant

;;;

But it also has to provide a **great user experience**

---

Thankfully, Google provides some **free tools** to help you start helping them.

;;;

### The Most Important Tool they give you is your Google Business Profile

;;;

This tool helps Google help you by making it easier for their bots to crawl, index, and return trustworthy, relevant, and authoritative results to searchers.

;;;

Best of all, it's **free to get set up**.

;;;

The **next most important** thing you can do is get Google Reviews

;;;

This shows searchers - and Google - that you're providing a valuable service 

---

These two steps **help a lot**

You should expect to see an SEO "bump" when you get it set up and complete as Google gives you an opportunity to compete for indexing.<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

But, if you don't maintain your profile, the **bump will fade...**

---

So, what can you do to stay ahead?

---

There are **6 things** you can do to maintain your 'search' momentum...

---

1. Claim Your Google Profile<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. Earn Google Reviews<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. Get Local Citations<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. Optimize Your Website<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. Blog Consistently<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
6. Network & Earn Links<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

We've already showed you how to claim your Google Business Profile...

;;;

But, there are some things you can do to keep it maintained...

;;;

For example, add **events**, **offers**, and **posts** when you create them.

;;;

If your staff can handle it, turn on messaging

---

And make sure you **respond to reviews**

;;;

(We've already talked about those, too)

---

So, what about **local citations**?

;;;

These are **legitimate** directories that specialize in _local_ information such as:

- Chambers of Commerce 
- Local associations
- Bing
- Yelp
- YP.com
- Tripadvisor
- etc.

;;;

Or, even **social channels** such as:

- Facebook
- Instagram
- Apple
- Alexa
- Etc

Where your business **name**, **address**, and **phone number** can be listed

;;;

This process is called ensuring **NAP Consistency** and ensures that when Google pulls information about your business from around the web, it's _complete_, _consistent_, and _coordinated_.

---

These citations aren't as strong as _shared/shareable backlinks_, but they do add some clout and help to keep the **search index maintained**.

---

But, perhaps the **most important thing** you can do _after_ you claim your Google Business Listing and start getting reviews, is **making sure your website is optimized** for search.

;;;

There's _a lot_ that goes into having a well-optimized website, but the **most important things** to ensure are:

1. That the website is fast, ideally loading in 3 seconds (or less)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. That it's mobile-friendly, if not mobile-first<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
3. That it's secure<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
4. That the on-page SEO is well-tuned<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
5. That it's got semantic snippets to help bots organize content on the website<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
6. And that it converts<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

We have several resources on these topics on our website.

(We'll post links below)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

But, for some of these, you'll _really_ want to make sure you get help from a developer who knows what they're doing.

---

Once you're website is optimized, the next step is to **blog.** 

;;;

There are a few reasons why blogging is still **one of the most important** tactics for ranking in search.

;;;

**First**, it gives the search engines more content to index.

;;;

This not only _expands your footprint_ on Google, but also shows Google _you're making an effort_ to be helpful to your customers.

;;;

What do I mean by "expanding your footprint?"

;;;

Think about the task of finding a needle in a haystack...

;;;

Would it be easier to find a needle if there were only 1-2 needles...

Or if there were dozens?<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

Search is no different. Each page is a needle in Google's haystacks. More needles = more opportunities to be found.

;;;

In fact, as you start to blog, you'll start to see that **your blog becomes your main entry way to your website.** 

;;;

Most of your visitors will come through there and _then_ find their way to conversion paths. 

---

But, obviously it's not _that_ simple...

(Otherwise everyone would be doing it)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

That's true.

;;;

"Garbage blogging" or "spam blogging" is probably _worse_ than **not blogging at all.**

;;;

Because then it's clear you're just trying to "game" the system.

---

For your content to be indexable, it has to be relevant to things people are searching and written well enough to be engaging.

(Ideally, shared)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

But, good posts, tied to things people are searching has another benefit:

**Increasing domain authority**<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

;;;

The more good blogs you post - and people read - the more your website is seen as _relevant, in general_ and not just for a specific query.

;;;

This creates a "multiplier" that makes **every other page rank higher** because your website is seen as "authoritative."

(There's that word again)<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### But what if you don't know what to blog about?

--- 

This part is actually easier than you think.

---

Start with the questions your _current_ customers **asked you most** when they were prospects.

---

This will help you get good content out there, in your unique voice, and start to get ranked.

;;;

But it'll **also save you** customer service calls and emails.

---

Still not sure where to start? 

;;;

That's ok, many people are afraid they're not good writers or don't think they have time to blog...

;;;

That's why we created a **Super Simple** blogging service to help businesses that _want to rank_ get great, SEO-optimized blogs...quickly.

;;;

And in your voice.
