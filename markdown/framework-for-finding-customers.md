Note:
One video, one idea

"How long until I rank in Google?"

;;;

"Advertising is too expensive"

---

## The intuition
- If I rank, people will find me, and I will have a pipeline of (essentially) free customers

;;;

**The intuition sounds good, but it's incomplete. And can be a cripplingly expensive myth for many small businesses.**

## What I'll cover in next few videos
- Finding your firehose
- The two types of channels
- Why advertising might be the cheapest way to get new customers (and why it's often viewed as 'expensive')
- The "Monopoly" approach to channel development
- How to choose your channel

## What I'll cover
- Why advertising might be cheaper (and faster) than ranking in Google
- Why

Supporting Points
- Tactics change, principles don't
  - Principles can be applied to any channel
- Everyone wants to rank in Google
  - Homepage/leadpage ranking intuitively makes sense
    - People searching, ready to buy
    - Oversimplification of how things really work, but that's the intuition
- What is a channel?
  - A way to distribute your goods, services, and messages to a group of people
  - Two broad types
    - People searching for you
    - You searching for people
- Identifying productive channels
  - Channel efficiency
  - Channel comfort
- What makes channels expensive
  - Leaky funnels
    - Low/no follow up in buying cycle
    - Low/no follow up after service
    - Not asking for referrals
  - Low pricing
  - High overhead/low profitability
  - Know cost of customer acquisition
- Deciding which channels to pursue
  - Depends on your business, channel efficiency, comfort
  - Rule of thumb: Start with channels where people search for you
    - Compelling offer
    - Good follow up
  - Invoke the "Monopoly" rule
    - 4 green houses, then a hotel
    - Once the channel is profitable and you have a good sense for customer lifetime value, test the next channel (in parallel)
      - Now, compounding

Transitions
